# VoronUsers user mod repository

Welcome to VoronUsers. This is a place to share your mods for the VoronDesign 3D printers and find useful mods and resources from other Voron community members.

Check the [`printer_mods`](./printer_mods) folder for mods that apply to the current generation of printers. 

All mods that apply to older (=legacy) printers can be found in the [`legacy printers`](./legacy_printers) folder.

Mods where the authors have abandoned development can be found in the [`orphaned mods`](./orphaned_mods/) folder. If you want to start maintaining one of them, feel free to reach out via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/issues/new/choose).

Looking to submit a mod? Check the [mod submission rules](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/wiki/Mod-Submission-Rules) and instructions on [how to submit to VoronUsers](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/wiki/How-to-Submit-to-VoronUsers)
