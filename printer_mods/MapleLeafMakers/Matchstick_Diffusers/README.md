## Compatibility

These mounts are only designed to fit the [Daylight-on-a-matchstick](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Daylight/Daylight_on_a_matchstick) and 
[Rainbow-on-a-matchstick](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Daylight/Rainbow_on_a_matchstick) LEDs.  Compatibility is not guaranteed with other 
designs. 

These prints require slightly larger than a 120x120 bed, so they cannot be printed on a V0, though they are designed to be used on one.
